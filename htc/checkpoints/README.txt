This directory is used to store the pre-trained model checkpoint.
The pre-trained model checkpoint can be downloaded from https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/htc/htc_x101_64x4d_fpn_16x1_20e_coco/htc_x101_64x4d_fpn_16x1_20e_coco_20200318-b181fd7a.pth.
I use this check point as the starting point for fine-tuning the model for web page segmentation.
This pretrained checkpoint is the work of the mmdetection team.
