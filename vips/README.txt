Notice:
While I tried to follow the guide found in the README.md of the repository (https://github.com/webis-de/ecir21-an-empirical-comparison-of-web-page-segmentation-algorithms),
I noticed many "NullPointerException" reported to the STDOUT while running the docker image to create the segmentations.
Still, all the segmentation generation runs completed with 0 exit status. After trying to flatten the segmentations, I noticed
that a lot of generated segmentation annotation file contains no segmentation or has wrongly formatted JSON annotation.
I tried my best to manually correct the badly formatted annotation files and tried to evaluate them against the ground-truth
annotations. The evaulation script reported error indicating the image sizes of the ground-truth annotations and the generated
annotations do not match for many annotations. Thus the result is very likely to be unreliable.
