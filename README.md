# EECE 570 Course Project -- Training Neural Networks for Web Page Segmentation
## Acknowledgments
In this course project, I utilized numerous open-source projects found on GitHub to develop my code as a newcomer to computer vision programming. Below, I provide a structured overview of the high-level acknowledgments, followed by a detailed list of acknowledgments for specific parts of the project.

1. The mmdetection project: The official repository of this project is https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection. It is an object detection framework, and I used the HTC model from this project. I made adjustments to the configuration files and followed the official tutorials to fine-tune an HTC model.
2. The "cikm20-web-page-segmentation-revisited-evaluation-framework-and-dataset" project: This repository contains the code from the paper listed below. The repository's address is https://github.com/webis-de/cikm20-web-page-segmentation-revisited-evaluation-framework-and-dataset. It provides multiple utility scripts written in R to post-process all the inferences I get from the models. I used them for many tasks, such as flattening bounding boxes and evaluating the segmentation. Reference: Kiesel, Johannes, et al. "Web page segmentation revisited: evaluation framework and dataset." Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management. 2020.
3. The "ecir21-an-empirical-comparison-of-web-page-segmentation-algorithms" project: This project contains code for the paper listed below. I adapted their scripts to make inferences from mmdetection models. My post-inference-processing pipelines in the batch_process_inference_results.py script are also following the post-process steps stated in this repository. That is, I followed the post-process procedures outlined in the README.md of this repository to process and evaluate the model inferences. The repository's address is https://github.com/webis-de/ecir21-an-empirical-comparison-of-web-page-segmentation-algorithms. Reference: Kiesel, Johannes, et al.

4. The YOLOX project: I used the project code given in the official YOLOX repository (https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) to fine-tune a YOLOX model. I used the scripts from this repository for fine-tuning and writing a customized inference script based on their demo script. I also wrote my experiment description files to configure the fine-tuning process based on the examples given in their repository. Reference: Ge, Zheng, et al. "Yolox: Exceeding yolo series in 2021." arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.08430 (2021).
5. The "simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch" project: My Faster RCNN implementation was adapted from Yun Chen's Faster RCNN implementation, which is given in this repository: https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch. I have made several changes to the original implementation, including but not limited to adding a new Coco-based dataloader for loading the webis-webseg-20 dataset, changing the inference script for generating inferences in a format that is compatible with the R scripts provided by Kiesel et al., adding an RPN only implementation and changing the anchor base sizes.

### Detailed Acknowledgements
1. The scripts for fine-tuning the HTC model (htc/train_htc.py): The python script is used to make changes to the base configuration for my specific training goal. After modifying the training configuration, it fine-tunes a model based on the modified configuration. This script is based on the tutorials given by the mmdetection team. The original tutorial notebooks can be found at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_InstanceSeg_Tutorial.ipynb and https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb.
2. The scripts used for making inferences from the fine-tuned HTC model: These python scripts are based on the relevant scripts given in the following repository: https://github.com/webis-de/ecir21-an-empirical-comparison-of-web-page-segmentation-algorithms Reference: Kiesel, Johannes, et al. "An empirical comparison of web page segmentation algorithms." Advances in Information Retrieval: 43rd European Conference on IR Research, ECIR 2021, Virtual Event, March 28–April 1, 2021, Proceedings, Part II 43. Springer International Publishing, 2021.
3. The "cikm20" subdirectory: This folder is a clone of the repository found at https://github.com/webis-de/cikm20-web-page-segmentation-revisited-evaluation-framework-and-dataset. It contains the code for analysis and post-process the JSON files recording the web page segmentation. Reference: Kiesel, Johannes, et al. "Web page segmentation revisited: evaluation framework and dataset." Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management. 2020.
4. The htc/mmdet-configs folder: This directory is used to record all the default and modified model configs of the mmdetection framework. The configuration files in this directory are copied from or based on the files in the following repository: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs.
5. The htc/customized-configs folder: This directory is used to record the modified HTC model configuration of the mmdetection framework. The configuration file in this directory is based on the files in the following repository: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs.
6. The htc/checkpoints folder: This directory is used to store the pre-trained model checkpoint. The pre-trained model checkpoint can be downloaded from https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/htc/htc_x101_64x4d_fpn_16x1_20e_coco/htc_x101_64x4d_fpn_16x1_20e_coco_20200318-b181fd7a.pth. I use this checkpoint as the starting point for fine-tuning the model for web page segmentation. This pretrained checkpoint is the work of the mmdetection team.
7. The yolox directory: This directory contains the files used for training YOLOX models and making inferences with trained YOLOX models. The code used here is based on the code given in the official YOLOX Github repository: https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX. More specifically, the demo.py, eval.py, and train.py scripts in the tools folder are taken directly from the official YOLOX repository and used. The infer.py script is based on the tools/demo.py script found in the official repository. The scripts found under the "exps" folder are also based on the experiment description files found in the "exps" folder in the YOLOX official repository. To use these scripts, one needs first to install the YOLOX packages as specified in the README.md of the official GitHub repository.
8. The vips folder: This folder contains the segmentations generated by the VIPS algorithm. The implementation used is retrieved from this repository: https://github.com/webis-de/ecir21-an-empirical-comparison-of-web-page-segmentation-algorithms. Reference:
