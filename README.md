1. The scripts for fine-tuning the HTC model
   :
   The python script is used to make changes to the base configuration for my specific training goal.
   After modifying the training configuration, it fine-tunes a model based on the modified configuration.
   This script is based on the tutorials given by the mmdetection team. The original tutorial notebooks can be found at
   https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_InstanceSeg_Tutorial.ipynb
   and
