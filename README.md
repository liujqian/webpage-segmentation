1. The scripts for fine-tuning the HTC model
   :
   The python script is used to make changes to the base configuration for my specific training goal.
   After modifying the training configuration, it fine-tunes a model based on the modified configuration.
   This script is based on the tutorials given by the mmdetection team. The original tutorial notebooks can be found at
   https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_InstanceSeg_Tutorial.ipynb
   and
   https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb.
2. The scripts used for make inferences from the fine-tuned HTC model:
   These python scripts are based on the relevant scripts given in the following repository:

3. The "cikm20" subdirectory: This folder is a clone of the repository found
   at https://github.com/webis-de/cikm20-web-page-segmentation-revisited-evaluation-framework-and-dataset. It contains
   the code for analysis and post-process the JSON files recording the web page segmentations.

4. The htc/mmdet-configs folder: This directory is used to record all the default and modified model configs of the
   mmdetection framework.
   The configuration files in this directory are copied from or based on the files in the following repository:
   https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs.
5. The htc/customized-configs folder: This directory is used to record the modified HTC model configuration of the
   mmdetection framework.
   The configuration file in this directory is based on the files in the following repository:
   https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs.
